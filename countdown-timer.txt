Countdown Timer:
 
 Create an HTML / CSS / JS page that displays a countdown timer
 
   - The user should be able to enter a value of minutes and seconds into two input boxes and then 
   select a 'Start' button which starts the timer. The timer then counts down to zero at which point it
   ends.
   
   - Have 'Pause' and 'Restart' buttons that pause the timer or restarts it using the current values.
   
   - Make sure to validate the input data
   
   - Be creative with displaying the countdown. You could:
      - display an animation in a <canvas> that changes as the timer decreases
      - use <svg> to display vector graphics of an analog clock face counting down
      - play sounds at specific intervals in the countdown 
      - flash the screen / play an animation when the timer reaches zero.
      - animate objects in the DOM during the countdown
   
   - Serve the page from your local webserver
   
   - Think carefully about how to organize your code. Don't litter the program with global variables (use at 
   most 1 global). Modularize your code.
   
   - Store everything in git. Create a new subdirectory in your repo. Push daily to github.
      
   - Comment your Javascript code
   
   - Do a design session in class before writing any code. You are responsible for creating and
   keeping up to date your design document which describes the purpose of your app, requirements,
   limitations, assumptions and how it works.

   - It is expected that most if not all of your code for this project will be original work. Please initially avoid the
   temptation to copy & paste the work of others; the more code you write yourself, the better programmer you'll become.
