Music Box app:
 
 Create a HTML / CSS / Javascript page that displays some controls that allow the user to compose simple melodies.
 
   - Every control should be mapped to an audio file (I have some of these already)
   
   - A click on a control should play an audio file at a particular pitch.
   
   - Apply appropriate styles to make the display look fun and appealing 
   
   - Map the controls to keyboard keys so that tapping a key plays the corresponding audio file
   
   - Implement a feature to record the keystrokes so the melody can be played back later.
   
   - Think carefully about how to organize your code. Don't litter the program with global variables (use at 
   most 1 global). Modularize your code.
   
   - Serve the app from your local webserver
   
   - Store everything in git. Create a new subdirectory in your repo. Push daily to github.
   
   - Do a design session in class before writing any code. You are responsible for creating and
   keeping up to date your design document which describes the purpose of your app, requirements,
   limitations, assumptions and how it works.
   
   - It is expected that most if not all of your code for this project will be original work. Please initially avoid the
   temptation to copy & paste the work of others; the more code you write yourself, the better programmer you'll become.
